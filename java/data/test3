'''Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, Aga Khan III''', [[Order of the Star of India|GCSI]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|GCIE]], [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], [[Imperial Privy Council|PC]] (2 November 1877 – 11 July 1957) was the 48th [[Shia Imam|Imam]] of the [[Nizari|Nizari Ismaili]] community. He was one of the founders and the first president of the [[All-India Muslim League]]. His goal was the advancement of Muslim agendas and protection of Muslim rights in India. The League until the late 1930s was not a mass organisation but represented the landed and commercial Muslim interests of the United Provinces (today's [[Uttar Pradesh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Keay|title=India: A History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3aeQqmcXBhoC&amp;pg=PA468|year=2001|publisher=Grove Press|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shared [[Syed Ahmad Khan]]'s  belief that Muslims should first build up their [[social capital]] through advanced education before engaging in politics. Aga Khan called on the [[British Raj]] to consider Muslims to be a separate nation within India. Even after he resigned as president of the AIML in 1912, he still exerted major influence on its policies and agendas.  He was nominated to represent India to the League of Nations in 1932 and served as President of the [[League of Nations]] from 1937–38.
