Acupuncture is a key component of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM).&lt;ref name=Liu-2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Gang|last2=Ma|first2=Hui-juan|last3=Hu|first3=Pan-pan|last4=Tian|first4=Yang-hua|last5=Hu|first5=Shen|last6=Fan|first6=Jin|last7=Wang|first7=Kai|title=Effects of painful stimulation and acupuncture on attention networks in healthy subjects|journal=Behavioral and Brain Functions|volume=9|issue=1|year=2013|pages=23|issn=1744-9081|doi=10.1186/1744-9081-9-23|pmid=23758880|pmc=3680197}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCM is largely [[pseudoscience]] with no valid [[mechanism of action]] for the majority of its treatments.&lt;ref name=swallow&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/448106a|title=Hard to swallow|year=2007|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7150/full/448106a.html|journal=[[Nature (journal)]]|volume=448|issue=7150|page=105|pmid=17625521}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has notions of a pre-scientific culture, similar to European [[humoral theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Traditional Chinese Medicine? |author=Steven Novella|publisher=Science-based Medicine|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine/|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to TCM, the general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that bodily functions are regulated by an energy called [[qi]] (氣) that flows through the body; disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Acupuncture describes a family of procedures aiming to correct imbalances in the flow of qi by stimulation of anatomical locations on or under the skin (usually called acupuncture points or acupoints), by a variety of techniques.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or by electrical stimulation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
